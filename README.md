Just a repository for learning how to use github

Hi Intelligent Creatures:

I am coming from Earth and start to learning programming seriously after forty. My familiar programming languages include Matlab, Python, C/C++, Verilog/Systemverilog/UVM,... Broad interests including, Mathematics, Physics, computure algorithm and architecture, baseband communication signal processing, digital signal processing, adaptive signal processing, machine learning and deep learning, FPAG/ASIC development,.... My trouble is exactly the too broad range of interests...
